# Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Performance Testing
This Python program implements three advanced sorting algorithms: Shell Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. It includes gap insertion sorting for Shell Sort, classic Lomuto partition Quick Sort, and a merge function for Merge Sort. The program tests these algorithms on random lists of sizes 20, 100, and 10,000, printing the original and sorted lists (when small) and timing each sort. It also implements a Quick Sort variant using median-of-three pivot selection to improve efficiency
